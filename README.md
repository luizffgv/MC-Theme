# MC-Theme

**MC-Theme** a GTK theme that looks like the game Minecraft. This repository
contains no game assets, so you will have to own the game.

Fonts, icons and cursors are not included.

## Build dependencies

- You have to own [**Minecraft Java**](https://www.minecraft.net) because you'll
  need the textures from inside your game's .jar file. Only tested with version
  1.19.2.
- [**ImageMagick**](https://imagemagick.org/) for scaling assets.
- [**sass**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) for compiling .sass.

## Usage

You can install the theme by running install.sh. Follow any instructions that
then show up.

## Does this work?

I'm not sure. I'm extremely new to making themes (and am having a hard time
finding resources), or even shell scripts.

## Is this theme official?

This theme is in no way official. It is not from Minecraft, not approved by
Minecraft and not endorsed by Minecraft.
